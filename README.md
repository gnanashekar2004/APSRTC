## Project Overview:
**Frontend**: The frontend of the application was developed using React JS, enhancing user interaction with the website. Material UI was used for designing the user interface, making it more intuitive and responsive.

**Backend**: Node JS and Express were used to create the server-side logic and RESTful APIs. These APIs enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth functionality of the application.

**Database**: MongoDB was chosen as the database to efficiently store and retrieve data related to user information, ticket bookings, and other relevant details.

**Authentication**: Email JS was integrated for email verification and password reset functionality, ensuring the security of user accounts.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Various stages of SDLC were followed, including Software Requirement Specification (SRS) preparation, UML designing, and thorough testing to deliver a high-quality and reliable application.
